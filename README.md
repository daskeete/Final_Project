[11.1% of households (14.3 million) in the United States are currently food 
insecure, meaning they are without reliable access to a sufficient quantity of 
affordable, nutritious food. One feature of food insecurity is embodied by 
the phenomenon of food deserts where residents lack adequate access to 
affordable, healthy food. Currently, more than 23 million households fall 
within a food desert. Food deserts are a spatial phenomenon, driven by 
socio-economic factors that have resulted in a public health crisis. Food 
deserts are often found in low-income and minority neighborhoods, and 
these populations are left at a greater risk of developing health problems. 
The obesity rate is notably high in populations of color. This is often 
because they lack the financial means to afford healthy foods and the 
physical access transportation to stores with healthy food. Instead, they are 
forced to rely on fast food and convenience stores that have low-quality, 
unhealthy foods that compromise the health of those that rely on them for 
sustenance. The link between socio-economic and health status and food 
deserts is clear, but what if we could leverage what we know about this 
relationship to our advantage?]



[Using a machine learning algorithm, it would be possible to further explore 
and isolate the features of a community that are most likely to lead to the 
creation of a food desert. The algorithm could then use what has been 
discovered about the correlation between key features and food deserts to 
predict and highlight communities that have a high chance of developing 
into a food desert. Ultimately this information could be used by 
policymakers and community development professionals to identify key 
community characteristics that lead to the creation of food deserts and 
ameliorate the root causes of food deserts, thus moving from a reactionfocused response to food deserts to a more sustainable, and beneficial 
prevention-focused response to food deserts.]


Problem Statement that introduces your selected topic, identifies significant goals associated with the implementation of your applied machine learning method, demonstrates why your problem is important, and describes and analyzes the complex nature of your problem including any process oriented causes and effects. Conclude your problem statement with a stated central research question. You are welcome to articulate a central research question in broad and general terms, given the abbreviated time frame for this investigation.
Problem Statement:

A problem is the difficulty that comes with analyzing online sentiment. Reports that firms like Many firms for example stocktwits use sentiment analysis and then sell that data to other firms that do momentum trading. To further showcase the value of sentiment data, in march a social media ETF was launched that analyzes social media sentiment towards particular stocks.
