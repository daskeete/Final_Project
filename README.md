Problem Statement that introduces your selected topic, identifies significant goals associated with the implementation of your applied machine learning method, demonstrates why your problem is important, and describes and analyzes the complex nature of your problem including any process oriented causes and effects. Conclude your problem statement with a stated central research question. You are welcome to articulate a central research question in broad and general terms, given the abbreviated time frame for this investigation.

Problem Statement:

Every year thousands of people lose their lives to suicide and even more around the world suffer from depression. People have many ways of expressing their feelings whether it be by making an online post or even writing a song. A lot of times when someone is lost to depression people are surprised or confused because they just could not see the signs leading up to the event. A few years ago lead singer of Linkin Park Chester Bennington committed suicide and as usual people were very surprised. People should not have to be left surprised by someone taking their own life so then what if we actually could create a machine learning algorithm that can analyze user generated content to determine whether the individual may/may not be showing signs of depression? After training the algorithm, i plant to test its efficacy by using song lyrics by said singer but this is more of a stretch goal.
